# Checkpoint

Checkpoint is an application to help business owners and admins to see in real time how many people is in the company's facility.
They could also filter people by name, role, date, and time. They could easily see how many hours have been spent in the facility
for each filtered group.

These features can help organizations manage reports and schedules, and handle urgency situations such as evacuations.
